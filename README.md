# L'art du dégradé

The Art of the Gradient is a trippy CSS Gradient Generator

#### Remaining To Do's (DELETE ME)

- ~~you can't click on the input/arrows for the furthest right color on the top layer because of the spinning button, need to add some padding on the right of the whole layer~~
- ~~switch to next~~
- ~~to add a route that takes a query param and renders just the gradient as a full page background~~
- ~~add the api function to generate an image based on the query param~~
- ~~allow query param with info to be passed to main page it uses to create a url to the api path that screenshots the screenshot route as the OG Image tag~~
- ~~a button that creates a link to our site with the query param~~
- if someone follows the link that page, it populates the atoms on load with the stuff from the url
- a share link that opens up a tweet modal with the link and example text "I made this. wby?"
- clicking increase/decrease arrows works but doesn't update what's in the input
- likewise reset buttons don't work either / seems like maybe you shouldn't make dragging the switch so much as focusing to type the switch
- make README
- add nice open graph image and tags
- add analytics
- add favicon
- add tests for each thing you can manipulate per style
- figure out why increase arrow gets hover style
- add background attachment option
- reset button appeared disabled when it shouldn't be
- now you can't have 0 when editing the inputs..., that's no fun
- import gradient from url button at the top, opens a modal where you paste the url
